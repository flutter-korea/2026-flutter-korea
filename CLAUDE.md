# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Bilingual (KR/EN) marketing site for the **Flutter Korea 2026** conference. Bun + SvelteKit (Svelte 5 runes),
fully prerendered with `@sveltejs/adapter-static`, deployed to GitHub Pages at
`https://flutter-korea.github.io/2026-flutter-korea/`.

## Commands

```bash
bun install          # dependencies
bun run dev          # dev server → http://localhost:5173
bun run build        # static build → ./build  (adapter-static, prerendered)
bun run preview      # preview the production build
bun run check        # svelte-check (types + a11y). Must be 0 errors / 0 warnings.
```

There is **no test suite**. `bun run check` is the gate — it runs `svelte-check` over every `.svelte`/`.js`
file and catches type errors, a11y issues, and unused code. Run it before considering a change done.

## Content model (edit here to change copy)

All user-facing text lives in **`src/lib/content.js`** as a single `dict` with two mirror trees, `dict.ko` and
`dict.en`, that **must keep an identical shape**. Components never hardcode copy; they read the active language
through the `t` derived store:

- `src/lib/i18n.js` — `lang` writable store (`'ko' | 'en'`, defaults `'ko'` to match the prerendered HTML) and
  `t = derived(lang, $lang => dict[$lang])`. Components read `$t.<section>.<key>`.
- `+layout.svelte` restores the saved language from `localStorage` **after mount** (not at module load) to avoid
  a hydration mismatch, then persists changes and keeps `<html lang>` in sync.
- Shared URLs (CFP Google Form, ticket platform, Flutter Seoul, contact email) live in the `links` export of
  `content.js`. The Call-for-Speakers form URL is here — update `links.cfp` to change it everywhere.

When adding a section/field: add the key to **both** `ko` and `en` with the same structure, or `svelte-check`
and prerender will surface the mismatch.

## GitHub Pages base-path rules (easy to get wrong)

The site is served from a **project subpath** (`/2026-flutter-korea/`), so path handling is load-bearing:

- **Every internal link must be base-prefixed.** Import `{ base } from '$app/paths'` and write
  ``href={`${base}/#about`}`` for on-page anchors, ``href={`${base}/speakers`}`` for routes. Anchors are written
  as ``${base}/#id`` (not bare `#id`) so they also work from the `/speakers` route by navigating home first.
  A bare leading-`/` href would break under the subpath.
- `svelte.config.js` sets `paths.base = process.env.BASE_PATH ?? ''` (empty locally). The deploy workflow sets
  `BASE_PATH=/<repo-name>` from the repo name, so links/assets resolve on any fork without code changes.
- SvelteKit emits **relative** asset/link paths (`./_app/…` from `/`, `../_app/…` from `/speakers/`) — verify
  after `bun run build` if you touch routing. `trailingSlash: 'always'` (in `+layout.js`) makes each route a
  directory with `index.html`.
- **Social meta is the exception:** `og:image` / `og:url` / `twitter:image` in `src/app.html` are **hardcoded
  absolute URLs** to the deploy domain (crawlers can't resolve relative paths). They also point at
  `og-image.png`, **not** the SVG (crawlers don't render SVG). **If the repo is renamed or moves to a custom
  domain, update those absolute URLs by hand.**

## Rendering & structure

- Fully static: `prerender = true` in `src/routes/+layout.js` cascades to all routes (home `/` and `/speakers/`).
  No server, no client data fetching.
- `+layout.svelte` is the app shell (skip-link → `Header` → `<main>` → `Footer`). `+page.svelte` just composes
  the home sections in order; each section is a self-contained component in `src/lib/components/`.
- **SSR safety:** components render on the server first. Never touch `window`/`document`/`localStorage`/
  `matchMedia`/`IntersectionObserver` at module or render scope — only inside `onMount`, event handlers, or a
  guarded `$effect`. The `reveal` scroll-in action (`src/lib/actions.js`, used as `use:reveal`) already guards
  these and honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Design system

`src/app.css` defines the whole visual language as CSS custom properties (`--bg`, `--accent`, `--text*`,
`--gradient-brand`, `--r-*`, `--font-mono`, `--section-y`, `--header-h`, …) plus utility classes (`.container`,
`.section`, `.kicker`, `.section-title`, `.section-lead`, `.btn`/`.btn-primary`/`.btn-ghost`, `.chip`, `.card`,
`.gradient-text`, `.reveal`). Components use **scoped `<style>` only** and reuse these tokens rather than
hardcoding colors, so theme changes are centralized. Sections follow a shared heading pattern
(`kicker` → `section-title` → `section-lead`) for vertical rhythm.

The theme is intentionally **flat**: the `--gradient-*` tokens hold *solid* colors (`--gradient-brand` = solid
button fill, `--gradient-brand-soft` = solid translucent tint, `--gradient-text` = solid heading accent) and
there are **no CSS `gradient()` functions anywhere** (no blueprint grids, no glow blobs). Keep it that way when
adding UI — use solids, and `.gradient-text` just sets `color`.

Responsive grids must self-clamp — use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, Npx), 1fr))` so a column can't exceed
the container and overflow at ~320px (body has `overflow-x: hidden`).

## "To be announced" sections

Sessions, Timetable, and Sponsors are intentionally in a **TBD state**: each renders its heading plus the shared
`ComingSoon.svelte` panel (badge / title / body / optional CTA). Tickets shows pricing but its purchase buttons
are a non-interactive "coming soon" state (`.tier-cta-tbd`). The active conversion path is speaker recruitment —
all "Apply to Speak" CTAs (Header, Hero, the CFP section) route to the `/speakers` overview page, whose Apply
button links out to the Google Form (`links.cfp`). When real content is confirmed, restore the detailed
rendering and update `content.js`.

## Deploy

Push to `main` → `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds with `BASE_PATH=/<repo>` and publishes to Pages
(`upload-pages-artifact` + `deploy-pages`; Pages source must be **GitHub Actions**). `static/.nojekyll` is
required so the `_app/` directory isn't stripped by Jekyll.

## Gotchas

- `svelte-check` needs **TypeScript pinned to v5** (`typescript@5`). TypeScript 7 (the native compiler) has a
  different package shape and crashes svelte-check 4.
- Config imports: `sveltekit()` comes from `@sveltejs/kit/vite` (in `vite.config.js`); `vitePreprocess` comes
  from `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` (in `svelte.config.js`). Mixing these up breaks the build.
- Fonts (Pretendard) load from a jsDelivr CDN in `src/app.html`; there is a system-font fallback stack in
  `--font-sans`.
